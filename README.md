# c-20-React-Portfolio

## Description

I built this portfolio to practice using React and to showcase applications I have worked on and have contributed to. This application includes a short biography, links to my deployed projects and their respective repos, a form that will one day allow people to directly message me and a fake email that will soon be replaced with my actual email, and a list of my developer proficiencies as well as a link to download a fake resume which will soon be replaced with my real resume. At the bottom of my application, my footer includes three icons that are links to my GitHub profile, LinkedIn profile, and Stack Overflow Profile. This project was styled exclusively using CSS.
